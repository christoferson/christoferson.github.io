Machine Learning - AI that learns with Experience

Deep Learning - Sub Category of Machine Learning that has automatic Feature Extraction

Convolutional neural networks are distinguished from other neural networks by their superior performance with image, speech, or audio signal inputs

A generative adversarial network (GAN) is a class of machine learning frameworks and a prominent framework for approaching generative AI.

Regression analysis
In statistical modeling, regression analysis is a set of statistical processes for estimating the relationships between a dependent variable (often called the 'outcome' or 'response' variable, or a 'label' in machine learning parlance) and one or more independent variables (often called 'predictors', 'covariates', 'explanatory variables' or 'features').

Linear Regression
In statistics, linear regression is a linear approach for modelling a predictive relationship between a scalar response and one or more explanatory variables (also known as dependent and independent variables), which are measured without error.  The case of one explanatory variable is called simple linear regression; for more than one, the process is called multiple linear regression.


Error - error of an observation is the deviation of the observed value from the true value of a quantity of interest.

Residual - residual is the difference between the observed value and the estimated value of the quantity of interest.
