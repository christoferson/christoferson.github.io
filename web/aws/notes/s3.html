	<p class="">AWS Simple Storage Service Notes</p>
    </header>
    <ol>
    <li>Amazon S3 objects can range in size from a minimum of 0 bytes to a maximum of 5 terabytes.</li>
    <li>largest object that can be uploaded in a single PUT is 5 gigabytes. For objects larger than 100 megabytes, customers should consider using the Multipart Upload</li>
    <li>Buckets - A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is contained in a bucket. </li>
    <li>Object - Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3. </li>
    <li>Key - A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a bucket has exactly one key. The combination of a bucket, key, and version ID uniquely identify each object. </li>
    <li>Region - choose the geographical AWS Region where Amazon S3 will store the buckets that you create.</li>
    <li>Updates are key-based. There is no way to make atomic updates across keys.</li>
    <li>Amazon S3 does not support object locking for concurrent writers. </li>
    <li>strong read-after-write consistency - After a successful write of a new object or an overwrite of an existing object, any subsequent read request immediately receives the latest version of the object.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Use Case</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Backup and storage – Provide data backup and storage services for others.</li>
    <li>Application hosting – Provide services that deploy, install, and manage web applications.</li>
    <li>Media hosting – Build a redundant, scalable, and highly available infrastructure that hosts video, photo, or music uploads and downloads.</li>
    <li>Software delivery – Host your software applications that customers can download.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>decide which AWS Region to store</p>
    <ol>
    <li>is near to your customers, your data centers, or your other AWS resources in order to reduce data access latencies.</li>
    <li>is remote from your other operations for geographic redundancy and disaster recovery purposes.</li>
    <li>enables you to address specific legal and regulatory requirements.</li>
    <li>allows you to reduce storage costs. </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Storage Classes</p>
    <ol>
    <li>S3 Standard - General purpose storage for any type of data, typically used for frequently accessed data</li>
    <li>S3 Intelligent - Tiering -  Automatic cost savings for data with unknown or changing access patterns</li>
    <li>S3 Standard - Infrequent Access - For long lived but infrequently accessed data that needs millisecond access</li>
    <li>S3 One Zone - Infrequent Access - For re-createable infrequently accessed data that needs millisecond access</li>
    <li>S3 Glacier - For long-term backups and archives with retrieval option from 1 minute to 12 hours</li>
    <li>S3 Glacier Deep Archive - For long-term data archiving that is accessed once or twice in a year and can be restored within 12 hours	</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Transition</p>
    <ol>
    <li>Before you transition objects from the S3 Standard or S3 Standard-IA storage classes, you must store them at least 30 days in the S3 Standard storage class. </li>
    <li>Minimum 30-Day Storage Charge for S3 Standard-IA and S3 One Zone-IA</li>
    </ol>
