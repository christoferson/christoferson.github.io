			<p style="color:blue;">Task Statement 1.1: Explain basic AI concepts and terminologies.</p>

            <p><strong>Objective 1: Define basic AI terms</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">AI is a broad field that
                        encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human
                        intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">ML is a subset of AI that focuses on
                        developing algorithms and statistical models that enable systems to learn from data and improve their
                        performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.
                    Identify Patterns, Find Correlation, Generate or Predict
                    </span></li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses
                        artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. It has been
                        particularly successful in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech
                        recognition.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Neural networks are computational models
                        inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. They consist of
                        interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) that process and transmit information, enabling the network to
                        learn and make predictions or decisions based on input data.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Computer vision is a field of AI that deals with
                        enabling computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos, similar to how humans perceive and
                        analyze visual information.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">NLP is a branch of AI that
                        focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, both written and
                        spoken.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Model:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">In the context of AI and ML, a model is a mathematical
                        representation or algorithm that learns patterns from data and makes predictions or decisions based on that
                        learning.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions or
                        rules that a computer follows to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Training and Inferencing:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Training refers to the process of
                        feeding data into a machine learning model and adjusting its parameters to minimize errors and improve its
                        performance. Inferencing, on the other hand, is the process of using a trained model to make predictions or
                        decisions on new, unseen data.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Bias:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Bias in AI refers to systematic errors or inaccuracies in
                        the data, algorithms, or models that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fairness in AI is the principle of ensuring that AI
                        systems treat individuals or groups fairly and without discrimination based on protected characteristics
                        such as race, gender, age, or disability.

                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fit:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">In the context of machine learning, fit refers to how well a
                        model represents or explains the underlying patterns in the training data.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Large Language Model (LLM):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">An LLM is a type of neural network
                        model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include
                        GPT-3, BERT, and LaMDA.</span></li>
            </ul>

            </ul>


            <p><strong>Objective 3: Describe various types of inferencing</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batch Inferencing:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">In batch inferencing, a trained machine
                        learning model processes a large amount of data in batches or chunks, rather than processing individual data
                        points one by one. This approach is suitable for scenarios where real-time predictions are not required, and
                        the data can be collected and processed in batches. For example, batch inferencing can be used for image
                        classification tasks, where a large number of images need to be processed and classified.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Inferencing:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Real-time inferencing, also known as
                        online inferencing or streaming inferencing, involves making predictions or decisions on individual data
                        points as they arrive, in real-time or near real-time. This approach is necessary for applications that
                        require immediate responses, such as voice assistants, self-driving cars, or real-time fraud detection
                        systems. Real-time inferencing typically requires low-latency and high-throughput models to ensure timely
                        and efficient processing of incoming data.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective 4: Describe the different types of data in AI models</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labeled Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Labeled data refers to data that has been manually
                        annotated or categorized with the correct labels or target values. This type of data is essential for
                        supervised learning tasks, where the model learns from examples with known outputs.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Unlabeled Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Unlabeled data refers to data that does not have
                        any associated labels or target values. This type of data is used in unsupervised learning tasks, where the
                        model tries to find patterns or structures within the data without any predefined labels.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Tabular Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Tabular data is structured data that is organized
                        in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or database table. This type of data is commonly used in tasks
                        like regression, classification, and recommendation systems.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Time-series Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Time-series data is a sequence of data points
                        indexed in time order, often collected at regular intervals. Examples include stock prices, sensor readings,
                        and weather data. Time-series data is used in tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern
                        recognition.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Image data refers to digital images, which are
                        represented as arrays of pixel values. This type of data is used in computer vision tasks like image
                        classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Text Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Text data refers to unstructured data in the form of
                        written language, such as documents, articles, or social media posts. This type of data is used in natural
                        language processing tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation.</span>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Structured data is data that is organized and
                        formatted in a predefined way, making it easy to store, process, and analyze. Examples include tabular data,
                        relational databases, and XML files.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Unstructured data is data that does not have a
                        predefined structure or format, making it more challenging to process and analyze. Examples include text
                        data, audio, video, and sensor data.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective 5: Describe supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Supervised learning is a type of machine
                        learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the input data is paired with the
                        corresponding correct output or target values. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping function
                        between the input and output variables, so that it can make accurate predictions or decisions on new, unseen
                        data. Examples of supervised learning tasks include image classification, speech recognition, and spam
                        detection.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Unsupervised learning is a type of machine
                        learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, meaning that the input data does not have any
                        associated target values or labels. The goal is for the model to discover patterns, structures, or
                        relationships within the data on its own. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering,
                        dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Reinforcement learning is a type of
                        machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a
                        reward signal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions, and it
                        learns to adjust its behavior accordingly over time. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like
                        game playing, robotics, and control systems.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #0066cc;">In summary, supervised learning is used when you have labeled data and a specific
                    target to predict, unsupervised learning is used to discover patterns and structures in unlabeled data, and
                    reinforcement learning is used when an agent needs to learn through trial-and-error interactions with an
                    environment.</span></p>

                    information to help financial institutions assess risk and make informed lending decisions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #0000FF;">Solution scalability:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Recommendation systems:</strong> ML-powered recommendation engines can analyze user preferences and
                    behavior to provide personalized recommendations for products, movies, or content, enabling scalable solutions
                    for e-commerce and streaming platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud detection:</strong> ML models can analyze vast amounts of transaction data in real-time to detect
                    fraudulent activities, enabling scalable fraud detection systems for financial institutions and e-commerce
                    platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #0000FF;">Automation:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Robotic process automation (RPA):</strong> AI and ML can automate repetitive and rule-based tasks, such
                    as data entry, form processing, and workflow automation, improving efficiency and reducing human errors.</li>
                <li><strong>Predictive maintenance:</strong> ML models can analyze sensor data from industrial equipment to predict
                    potential failures and schedule maintenance activities, reducing downtime and optimizing asset utilization.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective 2: Determine when AI/ML solutions are not appropriate (for example, cost-benefit analyses,
                    situations when a specific outcome is needed instead of a prediction).</strong></p>
            <p>While AI and ML can provide significant benefits in many applications, there are situations where they may not be
                appropriate or suitable. Here are some examples:</p>
            <p><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cost-benefit analyses:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the cost of developing and deploying an AI/ML solution outweighs the potential benefits or savings, it may
                    not be economically viable.</li>
                <li>For small-scale or low-complexity problems, traditional rule-based or manual approaches may be more
                    cost-effective than implementing AI/ML solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #0000FF;">Situations when a specific outcome is needed instead of a prediction:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In critical decision-making scenarios where a specific outcome is required, such as legal rulings or high-stakes
                    financial decisions, relying solely on AI/ML predictions may not be appropriate due to the potential for errors
                    or biases.</li>
                <li>In applications where interpretability and explainability are crucial, such as credit lending or healthcare,
                    traditional rule-based systems or expert systems may be preferred over opaque AI/ML models.
                    <br/>Probabilistic vs Deterministic. If Determinism is important, a rule-based system might be approprite.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective 3: Select the appropriate ML techniques for specific use cases (for example, regression,
