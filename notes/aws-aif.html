            <p><strong>Objective 1: Define basic AI terms</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Artificial Intelligence (AI):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">AI is a broad field that
                        encompasses the development of intelligent systems capable of performing tasks that typically require human
                        intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, problem-solving, perception, and decision-making.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Machine Learning (ML):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">ML is a subset of AI that focuses on
                        developing algorithms and statistical models that enable systems to learn from data and improve their
                        performance on specific tasks without being explicitly programmed.
                    Identify Patterns, Find Correlation, Generate or Predict
                    </span></li>
                <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Deep learning is a subset of ML that uses
                        artificial neural networks with multiple layers to learn hierarchical representations of data. It has been
                        particularly successful in areas like computer vision, natural language processing, and speech
                        recognition.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Neural Networks:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Neural networks are computational models
                        inspired by the structure and function of biological neural networks in the human brain. They consist of
                        interconnected nodes (artificial neurons) that process and transmit information, enabling the network to
                        learn and make predictions or decisions based on input data.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Computer Vision:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Computer vision is a field of AI that deals with
                        enabling computers to interpret and understand digital images and videos, similar to how humans perceive and
                        analyze visual information.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Natural Language Processing (NLP):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">NLP is a branch of AI that
                        focuses on enabling computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language, both written and
                        spoken.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Model:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">In the context of AI and ML, a model is a mathematical
                        representation or algorithm that learns patterns from data and makes predictions or decisions based on that
                        learning.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Algorithm:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">An algorithm is a set of well-defined instructions or
                        rules that a computer follows to solve a specific problem or perform a particular task.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Training and Inferencing:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Training refers to the process of
                        feeding data into a machine learning model and adjusting its parameters to minimize errors and improve its
                        performance. Inferencing, on the other hand, is the process of using a trained model to make predictions or
                        decisions on new, unseen data.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Bias:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Bias in AI refers to systematic errors or inaccuracies in
                        the data, algorithms, or models that can lead to unfair or discriminatory outcomes.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Fairness:</strong><span style="color: #0066cc;">Fairness in AI is the principle of ensuring that AI
                        systems treat individuals or groups fairly and without discrimination based on protected characteristics
                        such as race, gender, age, or disability.

                    </span>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Fit:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">In the context of machine learning, fit refers to how well a
                        model represents or explains the underlying patterns in the training data.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Large Language Model (LLM):</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">An LLM is a type of neural network
                        model trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human-like language. Examples include
                        GPT-3, BERT, and LaMDA.</span></li>

                <br/>
                <span>It's a common misconception that simpler algorithms are always more scalable. While it's true that algorithms like linear regression are computationally simpler, deep learning models like neural networks (including RNNs) actually have several advantages when it comes to scalability with large datasets. Here's why:</span>

                            <li><strong>Traditional ML:</strong> Often requires manual feature engineering, which becomes increasingly
                                difficult and time-consuming as datasets grow larger and more complex.</li>
                            <li><strong>Deep Learning:</strong> Automatically learns and extracts relevant features from raw data,
                                reducing the need for manual feature engineering and scaling better with complex, high-dimensional data.

                    learning models like RNNs can be more scalable for large, complex datasets, they also require more computational
                    resources and often more data to train effectively. For smaller datasets or simpler problems, traditional machine
                    learning algorithms may still be more appropriate and efficient. </p>
                <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;"> The choice between deep learning and traditional machine
                    learning should depend on the specific characteristics of your data, the complexity of the problem, available
                    computational resources, and the required model interpretability. </p>

            </ul>


            <p style="color:blue;font-weight:bold;">Self Attention in the context of Transformers</p>
            <p>
            <p>Imagine you're reading a story about a magical forest. The self-attention mechanism is like a special pair of glasses
                that helps you focus on the most important parts of the story as you read.</p>
            <p>Let's break it down:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "self" part: This means the story is looking at itself. It's not comparing itself to other stories, just
                    focusing on its own words and sentences.</li>
                <li>The "attention" part: This is like when you pay extra attention to something interesting or important.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Now, let's say you're reading this sentence in the story:</p>
            <p>"The old wizard cast a spell, and the tree began to dance."</p>
            <p>With your special self-attention glasses, here's what happens:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each word, the glasses help you look at all the other words in the sentence.</li>
                <li>They then help you decide which words are most important or related to the current word you're reading.</li>
                <li>This happens for every word in the sentence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>When you're reading "wizard," the glasses might make "spell" glow brighter because wizards often cast spells.
                </li>
                <li>When you're reading "tree," the glasses might make "dance" glow brighter because that's what the tree is doing,
                    which is unusual and important.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This process helps you understand the relationships between words better, even if they're far apart in the sentence.
            </p>
            <p>In a longer story, this would help you remember important details and connect ideas, even if they're mentioned in
                different paragraphs.</p>
            <p>So, when we say Transformers "use self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of different parts of the input,"
                we mean they have this special ability to look at every part of the input (like our story) and figure out which
                parts are most important or related to each other, helping them understand the overall meaning better.</p>
            </p>


            <p style="color: blue;font-weight: bold;">Simplified Implementation of Self-Attention in Transformers</p>
            <p>
            <p>Self-attention in Transformers is implemented through the following steps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Word Embeddings: Convert each word into a vector (embedding) representing its meaning and context.</li>
                <li>Query, Key, and Value Vectors: Create three vectors for each word: <ul>
                        <li>Query (Q): What the word is looking for</li>
                        <li>Key (K): What the word offers to others</li>
                        <li>Value (V): The actual content of the word</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Attention Scores: Compare each word's Query with every other word's Key to produce attention scores.</li>
                <li>Weighted Sum: Use attention scores to create a weighted sum of Value vectors, resulting in new word
                    representations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Scalability and Handling Permutations:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Parallel Processing: Calculate attention for all words simultaneously.</li>
                <li>Matrix Operations: Use efficient matrix multiplications for faster processing.</li>
                <li>Multi-Head Attention: Use multiple sets of Q, K, V vectors to capture different types of word relationships.
                </li>
                <li>Positional Encoding: Add positional information to embeddings to maintain sentence structure.</li>
                <li>Layer Stacking: Stack multiple layers of self-attention and feed-forward networks to capture complex
                    relationships.</li>
                <li>Contextual Understanding: Understand context across sentences and documents without storing all possible word
                    combinations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Transformers learn to generate appropriate attention patterns for given inputs, making them highly flexible and
                scalable for processing large amounts of text data, despite the vast number of possible word permutations and
                relationships.</p>
            </p>



            <p><strong>Objective 3: Describe various types of inferencing</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Batch Inferencing:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">In batch inferencing, a trained machine
                        learning model processes a large amount of data in batches or chunks, rather than processing individual data
                        points one by one. This approach is suitable for scenarios where real-time predictions are not required, and
                        the data can be collected and processed in batches. For example, batch inferencing can be used for image
                        classification tasks, where a large number of images need to be processed and classified.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Real-time Inferencing:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Real-time inferencing, also known as
                        online inferencing or streaming inferencing, involves making predictions or decisions on individual data
                        points as they arrive, in real-time or near real-time. This approach is necessary for applications that
                        require immediate responses, such as voice assistants, self-driving cars, or real-time fraud detection
                        systems. Real-time inferencing typically requires low-latency and high-throughput models to ensure timely
                        and efficient processing of incoming data.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective 4: Describe the different types of data in AI models</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Labeled Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Labeled data refers to data that has been manually
                        annotated or categorized with the correct labels or target values. This type of data is essential for
                        supervised learning tasks, where the model learns from examples with known outputs.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Unlabeled Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Unlabeled data refers to data that does not have
                        any associated labels or target values. This type of data is used in unsupervised learning tasks, where the
                        model tries to find patterns or structures within the data without any predefined labels.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Tabular Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Tabular data is structured data that is organized
                        in rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet or database table. This type of data is commonly used in tasks
                        like regression, classification, and recommendation systems.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Time-series Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Time-series data is a sequence of data points
                        indexed in time order, often collected at regular intervals. Examples include stock prices, sensor readings,
                        and weather data. Time-series data is used in tasks like forecasting, anomaly detection, and pattern
                        recognition.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Image Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Image data refers to digital images, which are
                        represented as arrays of pixel values. This type of data is used in computer vision tasks like image
                        classification, object detection, and image segmentation.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Text Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Text data refers to unstructured data in the form of
                        written language, such as documents, articles, or social media posts. This type of data is used in natural
                        language processing tasks like text classification, sentiment analysis, and language translation.</span>
                </li>
                <li><strong>Structured Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Structured data is data that is organized and
                        formatted in a predefined way, making it easy to store, process, and analyze. Examples include tabular data,
                        relational databases, and XML files.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Unstructured Data:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Unstructured data is data that does not have a
                        predefined structure or format, making it more challenging to process and analyze. Examples include text
                        data, audio, video, and sensor data.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong>Objective 5: Describe supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning.</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Supervised Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Supervised learning is a type of machine
                        learning where the model is trained on labeled data, meaning that the input data is paired with the
                        corresponding correct output or target values. The goal is for the model to learn the mapping function
                        between the input and output variables, so that it can make accurate predictions or decisions on new, unseen
                        data. Examples of supervised learning tasks include image classification, speech recognition, and spam
                        detection.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Unsupervised Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Unsupervised learning is a type of machine
                        learning where the model is trained on unlabeled data, meaning that the input data does not have any
                        associated target values or labels. The goal is for the model to discover patterns, structures, or
                        relationships within the data on its own. Examples of unsupervised learning tasks include clustering,
                        dimensionality reduction, and anomaly detection.</span></li>
                <li><strong>Reinforcement Learning:</strong> <span style="color: #0066cc;">Reinforcement learning is a type of
                        machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions and take actions in an environment to maximize a
                        reward signal. The agent receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties for its actions, and it
                        learns to adjust its behavior accordingly over time. This approach is particularly useful for tasks like
                        game playing, robotics, and control systems.</span></li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #0066cc;">In summary, supervised learning is used when you have labeled data and a specific
                    target to predict, unsupervised learning is used to discover patterns and structures in unlabeled data, and
                    reinforcement learning is used when an agent needs to learn through trial-and-error interactions with an
                    environment.</span></p>

                    behavior to provide personalized recommendations for products, movies, or content, enabling scalable solutions
                    for e-commerce and streaming platforms.</li>
                <li><strong>Fraud detection:</strong> ML models can analyze vast amounts of transaction data in real-time to detect

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Robotic process automation (RPA):</strong> AI and ML can automate repetitive and rule-based tasks, such

                    situations when a specific outcome is needed instead of a prediction).</strong></p>
            <p>While AI and ML can provide significant benefits in many applications, there are situations where they may not be
                appropriate or suitable. Here are some examples:</p>
            <p><span style="color: #0000FF;">Cost-benefit analyses:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>If the cost of developing and deploying an AI/ML solution outweighs the potential benefits or savings, it may
                    not be economically viable.</li>
                <li>For small-scale or low-complexity problems, traditional rule-based or manual approaches may be more
                    cost-effective than implementing AI/ML solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><span style="color: #0000FF;">Situations when a specific outcome is needed instead of a prediction:</span></p>
            <ul>
                <li>In critical decision-making scenarios where a specific outcome is required, such as legal rulings or high-stakes
                    financial decisions, relying solely on AI/ML predictions may not be appropriate due to the potential for errors
                    or biases.</li>
                <li>In applications where interpretability and explainability are crucial, such as credit lending or healthcare,
                    traditional rule-based systems or expert systems may be preferred over opaque AI/ML models.
                    <br/>Probabilistic vs Deterministic. If Determinism is important, a rule-based system might be approprite.

            <ul>
                <li>Used for grouping similar data points together based on their characteristics or features, without any
                    predefined labels.</li>

            </ul>
            <ul style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> <strong>Define Features:</strong>
                    <p>Features are the individual measurable properties or characteristics of the phenomena being observed. In
                        clustering, features are the attributes used to describe each data point or object that you want to cluster.
                        They are the basis for determining similarity or dissimilarity between data points. For example:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>In customer segmentation, features might include age, income, purchasing habits, and location.</li>
                        <li>In image clustering, features could be color histograms, texture patterns, or shape descriptors.</li>
                        <li>In document clustering, features might be word frequencies or topic distributions.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Selecting appropriate features is crucial as they directly impact the effectiveness of the clustering
                        algorithm.</p>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> <strong>Similarity Function:</strong>
                    <p>A similarity function (or distance function) is a mathematical measure used to quantify how alike or
                        different two data points are based on their features. It's fundamental to clustering because it determines
                        how the algorithm groups data points. Common similarity/distance functions include:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>Euclidean distance: The straight-line distance between two points in Euclidean space.</li>
                        <li>Manhattan distance: The sum of absolute differences between coordinates.</li>
                        <li>Cosine similarity: Measures the cosine of the angle between two vectors.</li>
                        <li>Jaccard similarity: Used for comparing set similarity.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The choice of similarity function depends on the nature of your data and the specific clustering problem.</p>
                </li>
                <li style="margin-bottom: 20px;"> <strong>Number of Clusters:</strong>
                    <p>This refers to the number of groups or clusters into which you want to partition your data. It's often
                        denoted as 'k' in algorithms like k-means. Determining the optimal number of clusters is a critical and
                        often challenging aspect of clustering. Consider:</p>
                    <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                        <li>It's usually specified by the user before running the algorithm (in algorithms like k-means).</li>
                        <li>Some algorithms can automatically determine the number of clusters (e.g., DBSCAN).</li>
                        <li>Various methods exist to help determine the optimal number, such as: <ul style="margin-left: 20px;">
                                <li>Elbow method</li>
                                <li>Silhouette analysis</li>
                                <li>Gap statistic</li>
                                <li>Information criteria (AIC, BIC)</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The appropriate number of clusters depends on the specific dataset and the goals of your analysis. It often
                        requires domain knowledge and experimentation to find the most meaningful clustering solution.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p style="font-family: Arial, sans-serif; line-height: 1.6;">These three concepts are fundamental to understanding and

	<div class="row">
		<div class="col-sm-12">
            <p><strong style="color: #0000FF;">Objective 1: Describe components of an ML pipeline (for example, data collection,
                    exploratory data analysis [EDA], data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter
                    tuning, evaluation, deployment, monitoring).</strong></p>
            <p>An ML pipeline consists of several components or stages that are typically followed during the development and
                deployment of machine learning models. Here are the key components:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Identify the Business Goal</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define success criteria for the project</li>
                        <li>Align stakeholders on objectives and expectations</li>
                        <li>Understand the business context and constraints</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Frame the ML Problem</strong></p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Define the ML task: specify inputs, desired outputs, and appropriate metrics</li>
                        <li>Assess the feasibility of using ML for the given problem</li>
                        <li>Consider starting with the simplest model options that could solve the problem</li>
                        <li>Conduct a cost-benefit analysis to ensure the ML solution is worthwhile</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Data Collection:</strong> This stage involves gathering and acquiring the necessary data from various
                        sources, such as databases, APIs, or external data providers.
                        <ul>
                            <li>Data sources - Static or streaming data</li>
                            <li>Data ingestion - ETL - Collect data from multiple sources and store in centralize repository. Must be repeatable to refresh with latest data.</li>
                            <li>Labels - Is the data labeled or how it can be labeled.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> EDA involves analyzing and understanding the collected data
                        by performing statistical analysis, visualizations, and identifying patterns, outliers, and potential
                        issues.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Data Pre-processing:</strong> This stage involves cleaning and preparing the data for model training.
                        It may include tasks such as handling missing values, removing duplicates, scaling or normalizing features,
                        and encoding categorical variables.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Feature engineering involves selecting, transforming, and creating new
                        features from the raw data that are most relevant and informative for the machine learning model.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Model Training:</strong> During this stage, the machine learning algorithm is trained on the prepared
                        data to learn patterns and relationships. This may involve splitting the data into training and validation
                        sets, and iteratively adjusting the model's parameters to improve its performance.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Hyperparameters are settings or configurations of the machine
                        learning algorithm that are not learned during training. Hyperparameter tuning involves finding the optimal
                        combination of hyperparameters that maximize the model's performance on the validation set.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> The trained model is evaluated on a separate test set or holdout data to assess
                        its performance using appropriate metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, or F1-score.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Deployment:</strong> Once the model has been evaluated and meets the desired performance criteria, it
                        is deployed into a production environment, where it can be used to make predictions or decisions on new,
                        unseen data.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Monitoring:</strong> After deployment, the model's performance is continuously monitored to detect
                        any drift or degradation in its accuracy or behavior. This may involve techniques like data drift
                        monitoring, model performance monitoring, and model retraining or updating when necessary.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>By including these initial steps, the ML pipeline now encompasses a more comprehensive approach that starts with
                understanding the business context and properly framing the problem before diving into the technical aspects of
                model development and deployment.</p>

                <li>
                    <p><strong>Training Custom Models:</strong> In some cases, it may be necessary to train a custom machine
                        learning model from scratch using your own data and specific requirements. This approach is often used when
                        pre-trained models are not available or do not meet the desired performance or domain-specific needs.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong style="color: #0000FF;">Objective 3: Describe methods to use a model in production (for example, managed API
                    service, self-hosted API).</strong></p>
            <p>Once a machine learning model has been trained and evaluated, there are several methods to deploy and use it in a
                production environment:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Managed API Service:</strong> Cloud providers like AWS offer managed services that simplify the
                        deployment and hosting of machine learning models as APIs. For example, Amazon SageMaker provides features
                        like SageMaker Inference, which allows you to deploy models as scalable and secure HTTP endpoints without
                        managing infrastructure.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Self-hosted API:</strong> Alternatively, you can deploy the trained model as a self-hosted API
                        service within your own infrastructure or on a cloud-based virtual machine or container. This approach
                        requires more setup and management but provides greater control and customization options.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Batch Processing:</strong> In some cases, models may be used for batch processing of large datasets,
                        where predictions or transformations are performed on the entire dataset at once, rather than serving
                        individual requests through an API.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Edge Deployment:</strong> For applications that require low latency or operate in environments with
                        limited connectivity, models can be deployed on edge devices or IoT devices for local inference and
                        decision-making.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>

            </ul>
            <p><strong style="color: #0000FF;">Objective 5: Understand fundamental concepts of ML operations (MLOps) (for example,
                    experimentation, repeatable processes, scalable systems, managing technical debt, achieving production
                    readiness, model monitoring, model re-training).</strong></p>
            <p>MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) is a set of practices and principles that aim to streamline and automate the
                end-to-end machine learning lifecycle, from data preparation to model deployment and monitoring. Here are some
                fundamental concepts of MLOps:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Experimentation:</strong> MLOps emphasizes the importance of conducting experiments, tracking
                        results, and maintaining reproducibility to facilitate iterative model development and improvement.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Repeatable Processes:</strong> MLOps promotes the use of automated and repeatable processes for data
                        processing, model training, and deployment, reducing manual effort and ensuring consistency.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Scalable Systems:</strong> MLOps systems should be designed to scale and handle increasing data
                        volumes, computational demands, and user traffic as the ML application grows.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Managing Technical Debt:</strong> MLOps practices help manage technical debt by promoting modular and
                        maintainable code, versioning, and documentation, making it easier to update and refactor components as
                        needed.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Achieving Production Readiness:</strong> MLOps focuses on ensuring that models are production-ready
                        by addressing issues such as model drift, data skew, and performance degradation through continuous
                        monitoring and retraining.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> Continuous monitoring of model performance, data drift, and system health
                        is essential to detect and address issues in a timely manner.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p><strong>Model Retraining:</strong> As data and environments evolve, models may need to be retrained or
                        updated to maintain their accuracy and relevance. MLOps practices facilitate efficient model retraining and
                        deployment processes.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p><strong style="color: #0000FF;">Objective 6: Understand model performance metrics (for example, accuracy, Area Under
                    the ROC Curve [AUC], F1 score) and business metrics (for example, cost per user, development costs, customer
