Instead of summarizing the content to say what were the questions and answers. I want to you provide a study notes instead. Like for the first question, just create a summary of what services were mentioned and considered. For each services what are they. It should contain information I need to know and study so I can answer the questions in the exam.



The following is an html content regarding the AWS Certified AI Practitioner certification exam.
It contains the following information:
1. Exam Objectives
2. Tasks and specific knowledges and skills required for each objective.
3. Lessons and information, explanation regarding each task.

The text is long and can contain duplicate inforamtion.
It can also be presented out of order or does not directly relate to the enclosing task.
I want to to create a more concise and organizaed version and does not sacrifice completeness.


Think step by step then output the information. No need to output your thought process, just write out the final version.
