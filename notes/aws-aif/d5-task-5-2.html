For example, ISO/IEC 42001 focuses on Artificial Intelligence Management Systems.</li> <li><strong>System and Organization Controls (SOC):</strong> These are a series of reports that focus on an organization's internal controls. For AI systems, SOC 2 is particularly relevant as it covers security, availability, processing integrity, confidentiality, and privacy.</li> <li><strong>Algorithm accountability laws:</strong> These are regulations that require transparency and accountability in algorithmic decision-making. An example is the EU's proposed Artificial Intelligence Act, which aims to regulate AI systems based on their potential risks.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 2: Identify AWS services and features to assist with governance and regulation compliance (for example, AWS Config, Amazon Inspector, AWS Audit Manager, AWS Artifact, AWS CloudTrail, AWS Trusted Advisor).</strong></p> <p>This objective focuses on understanding AWS services that help maintain compliance and governance. Key services include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>AWS Config:</strong> A service that assesses, audits, and evaluates the configurations of AWS resources.</li> <li><strong>Amazon Inspector:</strong> An automated security assessment service that helps improve the security and compliance of applications deployed on AWS.</li> <li><strong>AWS Audit Manager:</strong> A service that helps continuously audit AWS usage to simplify risk assessment and compliance with regulations and industry standards.</li> <li><strong>AWS Artifact:</strong> A self-service portal for on-demand access to AWS compliance reports.</li> <li><strong>AWS CloudTrail:</strong> A service that enables governance, compliance, operational auditing, and risk auditing of your AWS account.</li> <li><strong>AWS Trusted Advisor:</strong> A service that provides real-time guidance to help you provision your resources following AWS best practices.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 3: Describe data governance strategies (for example, data lifecycles, logging, residency, monitoring, observation, retention).</strong></p> <p>This objective requires understanding various aspects of data governance. Key concepts include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data lifecycles:</strong> The stages data goes through from creation to deletion. This includes collection, processing, storage, archiving, and disposal.</li> <li><strong>Logging:</strong> The process of recording events and activities related to data access and manipulation.</li> <li><strong>Data residency:</strong> The geographic location where data is stored and processed, which is important for compliance with local laws and regulations.</li> <li><strong>Monitoring and observation:</strong> Continuous tracking of data usage, access patterns, and system performance to ensure compliance and detect anomalies.</li> <li><strong>Data retention:</strong> Policies and practices for determining how long data should be kept and when it should be deleted or archived.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 4: Describe processes to follow governance protocols (for example, policies, review cadence, review strategies, governance frameworks such as the Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix, transparency standards, team training requirements).</strong></p> <p>This objective focuses on understanding the processes and protocols for maintaining effective governance. Key concepts include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Policies:</strong> Documented rules and guidelines that define how an organization manages and protects its data and AI systems.</li> <li><strong>Review cadence:</strong> The frequency at which governance policies and practices are reviewed and updated.</li> <li><strong>Review strategies:</strong> Methods used to assess the effectiveness of governance protocols, such as internal audits or third-party assessments.</li> <li><strong>Governance frameworks:</strong> Structured approaches to implementing governance. For example, the Generative AI Security Scoping Matrix helps organizations identify and mitigate security risks in generative AI systems.</li> <li><strong>Transparency standards:</strong> Guidelines for ensuring that AI decision-making processes are explainable and understandable to stakeholders.</li> <li><strong>Team training requirements:</strong> Ongoing education and skill development programs to ensure that team members are knowledgeable about governance protocols and can implement them effectively.</li> </ul>
