Reason: AWS Inferentia chips are custom-designed to provide high-performance machine learning inference at a lower cost compared to general-purpose CPU or GPU instances.</details> <br/> <p style="color: blue; font-size:14px;">Question 23: Which AWS feature helps in monitoring and optimizing costs for generative AI workloads?</p> <ul> <li>a.) Amazon Inspector</li> <li>b.) AWS Cost Explorer</li> <li>c.) Amazon CloudWatch</li> <li>d.) AWS Trusted Advisor</li> </ul> <details>Answer: b. AWS Cost Explorer. Reason: AWS Cost Explorer provides detailed visibility into your AWS costs and usage, allowing you to analyze your spending on AI workloads and identify opportunities for optimization.</details> <br/> <p style="color: blue; font-size:14px;">Question 24: What is a key consideration when choosing between multi-region and single-region deployment for a generative AI application on AWS?</p> <ul> <li>a.) Multi-region is always cheaper</li> <li>b.) Single-region provides better performance globally</li> <li>c.) Balancing global performance needs with cost and compliance requirements</li> <li>d.) Multi-region is required for all AI applications</li> </ul> <details>Answer: c. Balancing global performance needs with cost and compliance requirements. Reason: When deciding between multi-region and single-region deployment, it's important to consider the trade-offs between global performance, data transfer costs, and regional compliance requirements.</details> <br/>
