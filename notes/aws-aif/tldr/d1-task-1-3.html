			<p style="color:blue;">Task Statement 1.3: Describe the ML development lifecycle.</p>
			
			<p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 1: Describe components of an ML pipeline (for example, data collection, exploratory data analysis [EDA], data pre-processing, feature engineering, model training, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, deployment, monitoring).</strong></p> <p>The ML pipeline consists of several key components:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Gathering relevant data from various sources. For example, collecting customer purchase history for a recommendation system.</li> <li><strong>Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):</strong> Analyzing and visualizing the data to understand its characteristics. This might involve creating histograms, scatter plots, or correlation matrices.</li> <li><strong>Data Pre-processing:</strong> Cleaning and preparing the data for model training. This includes handling missing values, removing duplicates, and normalizing data.</li> <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Creating new features or transforming existing ones to improve model performance. For instance, combining 'first name' and 'last name' into a single 'full name' feature.</li> <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Using the prepared data to train machine learning models. This could involve algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks.</li> <li><strong>Hyperparameter Tuning:</strong> Optimizing the model's parameters to improve its performance. For example, adjusting the learning rate in a neural network.</li> <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessing the model's performance using various metrics. This might include accuracy for classification problems or mean squared error for regression tasks.</li> <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Putting the trained model into production to make predictions on new data. This could involve deploying as a web service or integrating into an existing application.</li> <li><strong>Monitoring:</strong> Continuously tracking the model's performance in production and watching for issues like data drift or model degradation.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 2: Understand sources of ML models (for example, open source pre-trained models, training custom models).</strong></p> <p>ML models can come from various sources:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Open Source Pre-trained Models:</strong> These are models that have been trained on large datasets and made freely available. Examples include BERT for natural language processing or ResNet for image classification. They can be used as-is or fine-tuned for specific tasks.</li> <li><strong>Training Custom Models:</strong> This involves building and training models from scratch using your own data. This approach offers more flexibility but requires more time and resources.</li> <li><strong>Transfer Learning:</strong> This involves using a pre-trained model as a starting point and fine-tuning it for a specific task. For example, using a pre-trained image classification model and adapting it to recognize specific types of plants.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 3: Describe methods to use a model in production (for example, managed API service, self-hosted API).</strong></p> <p>There are several ways to deploy ML models in production:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Managed API Service:</strong> Using cloud platforms like AWS SageMaker or Google Cloud AI Platform to host and serve your model. These services handle scaling and infrastructure management.</li> <li><strong>Self-hosted API:</strong> Deploying your model as an API on your own infrastructure. This gives more control but requires more management overhead.</li> <li><strong>Batch Prediction:</strong> Running the model on large batches of data periodically, rather than in real-time. This is useful for scenarios where immediate predictions aren't necessary.</li> <li><strong>Edge Deployment:</strong> Deploying models directly on edge devices like smartphones or IoT devices for local inference.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 4: Identify relevant AWS services and features for each stage of an ML pipeline (for example, SageMaker, Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler, Amazon SageMaker Feature Store, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor).</strong></p> <p>AWS offers various services for different stages of the ML pipeline:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data Collection:</strong> Amazon S3 for data storage, AWS Glue for data cataloging</li> <li><strong>Data Preparation:</strong> Amazon SageMaker Data Wrangler for data preparation and feature engineering</li> <li><strong>Feature Engineering:</strong> Amazon SageMaker Feature Store for feature management and sharing</li> <li><strong>Model Training:</strong> Amazon SageMaker for model training and hyperparameter tuning</li> <li><strong>Model Deployment:</strong> Amazon SageMaker for model deployment and hosting</li> <li><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor for production model monitoring</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 5: Understand fundamental concepts of ML operations (MLOps) (for example, experimentation, repeatable processes, scalable systems, managing technical debt, achieving production readiness, model monitoring, model re-training).</strong></p> <p>MLOps involves several key concepts:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Experimentation:</strong> Systematically testing different models and approaches to improve performance.</li> <li><strong>Repeatable Processes:</strong> Creating standardized, automated workflows for model development and deployment.</li> <li><strong>Scalable Systems:</strong> Designing infrastructure that can handle increasing data volumes and model complexity.</li> <li><strong>Managing Technical Debt:</strong> Regularly refactoring code, updating dependencies, and improving documentation to maintain system health.</li> <li><strong>Achieving Production Readiness:</strong> Ensuring models meet performance, reliability, and scalability requirements before deployment.</li> <li><strong>Model Monitoring:</strong> Continuously tracking model performance and data distributions in production.</li> <li><strong>Model Re-training:</strong> Regularly updating models with new data to maintain performance over time.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 6: Understand model performance metrics (for example, accuracy, Area Under the ROC Curve [AUC], F1 score) and business metrics (for example, cost per user, development costs, customer feedback, return on investment [ROI]) to evaluate ML models.</strong></p> <p>Model evaluation involves both technical and business metrics:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Technical Metrics:</strong> <ul> <li>Accuracy: The proportion of correct predictions among the total number of cases examined.</li> <li>Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC): A measure of the model's ability to distinguish between classes.</li> <li>F1 Score: The harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for imbalanced datasets.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Business Metrics:</strong> <ul> <li>Cost per User: The operational cost of running the model per user served.</li> <li>Development Costs: The resources invested in creating and maintaining the model.</li> <li>Customer Feedback: Direct input from users on the model's performance or impact.</li> <li>Return on Investment (ROI): The financial benefits gained from the model compared to its costs.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Understanding both types of metrics is crucial for assessing the overall success and impact of an ML model in a business context.</p>
