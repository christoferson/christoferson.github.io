			<p style="color:blue;">Task Statement 2.1: Explain the basic concepts of generative AI.</p>
			
			<p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 1: Understand foundational generative AI concepts (for example, tokens, chunking, embeddings, vectors, prompt engineering, transformer-based LLMs, foundation models, multi-modal models, diffusion models).</strong></p> <p>This objective covers several key concepts in generative AI:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Tokens:</strong> The basic units of text that AI models process. For example, in the sentence "The cat sat on the mat," each word might be a separate token.</li> <li><strong>Chunking:</strong> The process of breaking down large pieces of text into smaller, manageable segments. This is crucial for processing long documents or conversations.</li> <li><strong>Embeddings:</strong> Dense vector representations of words or phrases that capture semantic meaning. For instance, the words "king" and "queen" would have similar embeddings due to their related meanings.</li> <li><strong>Vectors:</strong> Mathematical representations of data points in multi-dimensional space. In AI, vectors are used to represent various types of information, including text and images.</li> <li><strong>Prompt engineering:</strong> The art of crafting effective input prompts to guide AI models to produce desired outputs. For example, asking "Explain quantum computing as if I'm five years old" instead of just "What is quantum computing?"</li> <li><strong>Transformer-based LLMs:</strong> Large Language Models based on the Transformer architecture, which use self-attention mechanisms to process and generate text. Examples include GPT-3 and BERT.</li> <li><strong>Foundation models:</strong> Large, general-purpose AI models trained on vast amounts of data that can be fine-tuned for specific tasks. GPT-3 is a well-known example of a foundation model.</li> <li><strong>Multi-modal models:</strong> AI models that can process and generate multiple types of data, such as text, images, and audio. DALL-E is an example that can generate images from text descriptions.</li> <li><strong>Diffusion models:</strong> A type of generative model that learns to gradually denoise data, often used in image generation. Stable Diffusion is a popular example of this type of model.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 2: Identify potential use cases for generative AI models (for example, image, video, and audio generation; summarization; chatbots; translation; code generation; customer service agents; search; recommendation engines).</strong></p> <p>This objective focuses on understanding the various applications of generative AI:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Image, video, and audio generation:</strong> Creating new visual and auditory content. For example, DALL-E generating images from text descriptions, or WaveNet synthesizing realistic human-like voices.</li> <li><strong>Summarization:</strong> Condensing long texts into shorter, coherent summaries. This is useful for quickly understanding lengthy documents or articles.</li> <li><strong>Chatbots:</strong> AI-powered conversational agents that can interact with users in natural language. Examples include customer support chatbots on websites.</li> <li><strong>Translation:</strong> Automatically converting text or speech from one language to another. Google Translate is a well-known example of this technology.</li> <li><strong>Code generation:</strong> Creating programming code based on natural language descriptions or specifications. GitHub Copilot is an example of this technology.</li> <li><strong>Customer service agents:</strong> AI systems that can handle customer inquiries and provide support, often integrating with chatbot technology.</li> <li><strong>Search:</strong> Enhancing search engines with AI to provide more relevant and context-aware results. Google's BERT implementation in search is an example of this.</li> <li><strong>Recommendation engines:</strong> Systems that suggest products, content, or services based on user preferences and behavior. Netflix's movie recommendation system is a prime example.</li> </ul> <p style="color: #0066cc;"><strong>Objective 3: Describe the foundation model lifecycle (for example, data selection, model selection, pre-training, fine-tuning, evaluation, deployment, feedback).</strong></p> <p>This objective covers the stages involved in developing and deploying a foundation model:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Data selection:</strong> Choosing appropriate, diverse, and high-quality datasets for training. For example, selecting a mix of books, articles, and websites for a language model.</li> <li><strong>Model selection:</strong> Deciding on the architecture and size of the model based on the task and available resources. This could involve choosing between models like BERT or GPT, and determining the number of parameters.</li> <li><strong>Pre-training:</strong> The initial training phase where the model learns general knowledge from a large corpus of data. This is typically done on massive datasets without specific task-oriented fine-tuning.</li> <li><strong>Fine-tuning:</strong> Adapting the pre-trained model to specific tasks or domains by training on smaller, task-specific datasets. For instance, fine-tuning a general language model for medical terminology.</li> <li><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Assessing the model's performance on various metrics and tasks to ensure it meets the required standards. This might involve testing on benchmark datasets or real-world scenarios.</li> <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Putting the model into production, which involves considerations like scalability, latency, and integration with existing systems.</li> <li><strong>Feedback:</strong> Collecting and analyzing user interactions and results to continuously improve the model. This could involve monitoring performance, gathering user feedback, and identifying areas for improvement.</li> </ul> <p>Understanding this lifecycle is crucial for effectively developing, implementing, and maintaining AI models in real-world applications.</p>
