To detect bias and explain model predictions</li> <li>c.) To automate model deployment</li> <li>d.) To generate synthetic training data</li> </ul> <details> Answer: b. To detect bias and explain model predictions
			Reason: Amazon SageMaker Clarify is specifically designed to help detect bias in machine learning models and provide explanations for model predictions. It offers features such as bias detection in data and models, feature importance analysis, and SHAP values for model explanations.
			
			</details> <br/> <p style="color: blue; font-size:14px;">Question 3: In the context of machine learning, what does high bias typically lead to?</p> <ul> <li>a.) Overfitting</li> <li>b.) Underfitting</li> <li>c.) Perfect generalization</li> <li>d.) Increased model complexity</li> </ul> <details> Answer: b. Underfitting
			Reason: High bias in machine learning models typically leads to underfitting. This means the model is too simplistic to capture the underlying patterns in the data, resulting in poor performance on both training and test data. High bias is often associated with oversimplified models that fail to capture the complexity of the problem.
			
			</details> <br/> <p style="color: blue; font-size:14px;">Question 4: Which of the following is a key characteristic of an ethical dataset for AI training?</p> <ul> <li>a.)
