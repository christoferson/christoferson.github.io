			<p style="color: goldenrod; font-size:16px;"><strong>Example Exam Questions</strong></p> <ol> <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> A data science team is implementing a CI/CD pipeline for their ML project using AWS services. They want to automatically trigger model retraining when new data is added to an S3 bucket. Which AWS service should they use to detect the new data and initiate the retraining process?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> AWS Lambda<br> <strong>B)</strong> Amazon EventBridge<br> <strong>C)</strong> AWS Step Functions<br> <strong>D)</strong> Amazon SQS</p> <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B) Amazon EventBridge</p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Amazon EventBridge is ideal for creating event-driven architectures. It can detect changes in S3 buckets and trigger other AWS services, making it perfect for initiating model retraining when new data arrives.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> An ML engineer is setting up a deployment pipeline for a critical machine learning model. The team wants to ensure zero downtime during updates and the ability to quickly rollback if issues are detected. Which deployment strategy should they use?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> In-place deployment<br> <strong>B)</strong> Rolling deployment<br> <strong>C)</strong> Blue/Green deployment<br> <strong>D)</strong> Canary deployment</p> <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C) Blue/Green deployment</p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Blue/Green deployment allows for zero downtime updates and quick rollbacks by maintaining two identical production environments. This strategy is ideal for critical applications where minimizing downtime and risk is crucial.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> A team is using AWS CodePipeline for their ML workflow. They want to ensure that their model meets certain performance criteria before it's deployed to production. Which AWS service should they integrate into their pipeline to automatically evaluate the model's performance?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> AWS CloudWatch<br> <strong>B)</strong> AWS CodeBuild<br> <strong>C)</strong> Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor<br> <strong>D)</strong> AWS Lambda</p> <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B) AWS CodeBuild</p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> AWS CodeBuild can be used to run custom scripts, including model evaluation scripts. It can be integrated into CodePipeline to automatically evaluate model performance as part of the CI/CD process.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> An ML team is struggling with inconsistent feature engineering between their training and inference pipelines. Which AWS service should they consider implementing to address this issue?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Amazon S3<br> <strong>B)</strong> Amazon SageMaker Feature Store<br> <strong>C)</strong> Amazon DynamoDB<br> <strong>D)</strong> AWS Glue</p> <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> B) Amazon SageMaker Feature Store</p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> Amazon SageMaker Feature Store provides a centralized repository for storing, managing, and serving machine learning features. It ensures consistency between training and inference pipelines, addressing the team's issue.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Question:</strong> A data scientist is working on a project that requires versioning both code and large datasets. They're already using Git for code versioning. What tool should they consider for versioning their datasets?</p> <p><strong>A)</strong> Git LFS<br> <strong>B)</strong> Amazon S3 versioning<br> <strong>C)</strong> DVC (Data Version Control)<br> <strong>D)</strong> AWS CodeCommit</p> <p><strong>Correct Answer:</strong> C) DVC (Data Version Control)</p> <p><strong>Explanation:</strong> While Git LFS can handle large files, DVC is specifically designed for versioning large datasets and works alongside Git. It's ideal for ML projects that need to version both code and data.</p></li> </ol> <p>These questions cover various aspects of the exam topics, including AWS services, deployment strategies, ML-specific concerns, and best practices. They test not just factual knowledge, but also the ability to apply concepts to real-world scenarios.</p>
