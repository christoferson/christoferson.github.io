		<h3 class="text-primary h4">Hybrid Network DNS</h3>
		<p>Hybrid networking involves connecting on-premises networks with Amazon VPCs. One of the challenges in hybrid networks is DNS resolution, as you need to ensure that DNS queries can be forwarded between the on-premises data center and Amazon VPCs. AWS offers solutions like Route 53 Resolver to enable seamless DNS management.</p>

		<h3 class="text-primary h4">Route 53 Endpoints</h3>
		<p>Amazon Route 53 Resolver is used for hybrid DNS resolution across multiple accounts and VPCs, offering a centralized DNS management approach. The resolver integrates with on-premises DNS resolvers to provide a unified DNS resolution across your network.</p>
		<div class="row">
			<ul>
				<p>Primer</p>
				<li>DNS via the VPC .2 Address. e.g., 10.16.0.2</li>
				<li>.2 is reserved in every subnet</li>
				<li>Now called the Route53 Resolver</li>
				<li>Provides Route53 Public and Associated Private Zones</li>
				<li>Assuming no or prior to Route 53 Endpoints - Only Accessible from within a VPC</li>
			</ul>
			<ul>
				<li>VPC Interfaces (ENI) - Accessible over VPN or DX</li>
				<li>2 Types - Inbound and Outbound</li>
				<li>Inbound - On Premises can forward to the R53 Resolver</li>
				<li>Outbound - Conditional Forwarders, R53 to On-Premises</li>
				<li>Rules control what requests are forwarded</li>
				<li>
					<p>Scenario: corp.acme.org -> On Premise DNS Nameservers</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Define a rule to forward requests within corp.acme.org to On Premise</li>
						<li>Specify On Premise DNS Servers</li>
						<li>When matching query is received, outbound endpoints will forward the query to On Premise DNS Server</li>
						<li>Since outbound endpoint has IP Address, you can whitelist them on premises</li>
					</ul>
				</li>
			</ul>

		<h3 class="text-primary h4">Centralized DNS Management with Route 53 Resolver</h3>
		<p>In hybrid cloud environments, managing DNS resolution across both on-premises infrastructure and AWS VPCs can be complex. Route 53 Resolver offers centralized DNS management, allowing you to resolve DNS names from on-premises to VPCs and vice versa. This is especially important when dealing with multiple VPCs in different accounts.</p>
		<h4>Design Goals with Route 53 Resolver</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Fully managed service that handles DNS resolution with high availability and reliability</li>
			<li>Provides query volume metrics in CloudWatch</li>
			<li>Preserves Availability Zone isolation and local answers</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Best Practices for Route 53 Resolver</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Use .2 for DNS resolution on EC2 instances for better packet handling</li>
			<li>Ensure DHCP option sets point to AmazonProvidedDNS</li>
			<li>Use forwarding rules sparingly, only when necessary</li>
			<li>Consider sharing and associating private hosted zones directly across VPCs to reduce complexity and cost</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Key Setup Steps for Centralized DNS</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Establish network connectivity between VPCs and on-premises using AWS Transit Gateway and Site-to-Site VPN or AWS Direct Connect</li>
			<li>Set up Route 53 Resolver endpoints for both inbound and outbound traffic, ensuring high availability by selecting IPs from multiple Availability Zones</li>
			<li>Create and associate private hosted zones across VPCs and accounts</li>
			<li>Use conditional forwarding rules to forward DNS queries to on-premises DNS servers</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-primary h4">Sharing PrivateLink Endpoints Between VPCs</h3>
		<p>In environments where AWS services like Amazon SQS or Amazon ECS are accessed securely via PrivateLink, DNS resolution needs to be consistent across VPCs. By sharing PrivateLink endpoints between VPCs, you can reduce costs and simplify management.</p>
		<h4>Steps to Set Up Shared PrivateLink Endpoints</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Use AWS Transit Gateway for network connectivity between VPCs</li>
			<li>Configure Route 53 Resolver endpoints in the shared services VPC</li>
			<li>Create and associate private hosted zones for AWS services accessed via PrivateLink</li>
			<li>Use alias records for services like Amazon SQS to resolve to private IP addresses</li>
		</ul>
		<h4>Considerations</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Be mindful of cross-Availability Zone networking charges and latency</li>
			<li>Map Availability Zone names to Availability Zone IDs when working across accounts to ensure consistency</li>
		</ul>

		<h3 class="text-primary h4">Centralize Access Using VPC Interface Endpoints to Access AWS Services Across Multiple VPCs</h3>
		<p>Security and cost are always a top priority for AWS customers when designing their network. Amazon VPC and its related networking components, like VPC endpoints, allow private connectivity between your VPCs and AWS services. VPC interface endpoints, powered by AWS PrivateLink, allow secure, scalable, and private access to services like Amazon SQS across multiple VPCs.</p>
		
		<h4>My Notes</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>As number of VPCs in your account grow, centralizing the interface endpoints might be cost efficient solution.</li>
		</ul>

		<h4>Key Setup Steps for VPC Interface Endpoints</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Create a hub VPC with interface VPC endpoints for AWS services (e.g., Amazon SQS)</li>
			<li>Set up VPC peering between spoke and hub VPCs</li>
			<li>Enable private DNS for interface VPC endpoints</li>
			<li>Create a Private Hosted Zone and associate it with peered VPCs for DNS resolution</li>
			<li>Use AWS CLI or SDK with the --endpoint-url parameter to interact with services through the private endpoint</li>
		</ul>
		
		<h4>Additional Configuration for DNS Resolution Across VPCs</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Disable Private DNS in the hub VPC if it’s enabled</li>
			<li>Create and associate a Private Hosted Zone for the AWS service endpoints (e.g., sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com)</li>
			<li>Ensure cross-VPC DNS resolution by associating the Private Hosted Zone with spoke VPCs</li>
		</ul>
	
		<h4>Considerations</h4>
		<ul>
			<li>Ensure high availability by distributing interface VPC endpoints across multiple Availability Zones</li>
			<li>Monitor interface endpoint limits (e.g., 50 per VPC) and request increases if necessary</li>
			<li>Evaluate network costs, especially in cross-Availability Zone configurations</li>
		</ul>
